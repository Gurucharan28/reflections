How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because if you have a history, you can easily compare the file's different versions without checking manually, where the older version you need is located

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros- You can commit according to your wish
    Cons- You may have to wisely add commit points manually

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because, changes in one file might need to be reflected in some other files too, so Git helps in this by saving multiple files in one commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log can be used to view all the commits and info related to them, whereas using git diff you can see all the differences between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because, you can always get back to the older version if you're using a version control and make a mistake!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    A project, maybe
